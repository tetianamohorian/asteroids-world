# 🚀 Asteroids World

A simple terminal-based C game inspired by classic arcade-style space shooters. Developed as part of a systems programming exercise, this project showcases low-level programming skills, structured code architecture, and Makefile automation.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Real-time gameplay loop implemented in C
- Modular code structure: separate files for game logic, world generation, and main loop
- Custom Makefile for building the project
- Runs directly in the terminal
- Collision detection and simple game physics

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- C (C99 Standard)
- GCC Compiler
- Make (GNU Make)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── game.c / .h      # Game logic (movement, collision, scoring)
├── world.c / .h     # World generation (map, obstacles, enemies)
├── main.c           # Main entry point of the program
├── Makefile         # Build configuration
├── README.md        # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Build the game**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   ./game
   ```

3. **Clean build files**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated

- Low-level memory management and struct usage
- Separation of concerns in C (modular design)
- Understanding of compilation and linking
- Use of Makefile for project automation
- Debugging with `gdb`
